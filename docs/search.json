The section is mainly used to set up timing windows (or restricted activity periods) and the scores should be computed.\nRisk Score Time Series\nThe main plot displays the score values throughout the year as an interactive time series. It supports zooming and exploration. Colored areas represent timing windows (or restricted activity periods).\nTiming Window Scores\nBelow the plot, the integrated score is presented as a percentage, along with the number of days that fall within the timing windows (or restricted activity periods). A colored square indicates the corresponding score on the main plot.\nReport and Bundle\nYou can download a report by clicking “Download Report”, which currently includes all input data as tables and the initial waterbody plot. The “Download Bundle” provides all data tables as CSV files bundled in a ZIP archive.\n\n\n\n\nCalculator 1. Left Panel; 2. Risk Score Time Series; 3. Timing Window Scores; 4. Report and Bundle.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Definitions\nThe Risk Score Time Series is generated by summing all life process periods across the selected species. Each life process period is assigned a value of 1, while all other times of the year are assigned 0. By summing these values, the time series reflects the number of overlapping life processes occurring at any given time—serving as a proxy for biological risk during that period.\nThe Timing Window Score reflects the percentage of biological risk that is covered by the defined timing windows. It is calculated using the following formula:\n\\[\nS_{tw} = 100\\frac{\\sum_{tw} \\text{Risk Score}}{\\sum_{y} \\text{Risk Score}}\n\\]\nwhere ( tw ) represents the timing window period, and ( y ) represents the entire year.\nBy definition, lower scores indicate greater mitigation, as a smaller proportion of the total biological risk overlaps with the timing window.Similarly, Restricted Activity Period (RAP) scores are computed using the same formula but applied to periods of activity restriction. In this case then, lower scores indicate stronger mitigation.\nThe calculator offers also a period of interest to restrain your choice and guide the calculation of the optimal window. By default, all the species are used without any snsitivity. Cecj the box ‘Use sensitivity to stressors’ to use the values seelcted in ‘WUA selection’. Also teh last section of options allowthe user to weight all species. This is a way to explore the individual score (e.g. setting all weight to 0 but for one species).\nHere’s a cleaned-up and well-structured version of your paragraph, improving grammar, clarity, and consistency while preserving your meaning:\n\n\n3.6.3 Score display options\nUp to three scores can be displayed in the results:\n\nCurrent: The score for the period currently selected by the user. If needed, a second window can be defined to use two sub-periods.\nOptimal: The best possible score, computed by evaluating all possible periods. If multiple windows yield the same optimal score, only the first one chronologically is shown.\nStatus quo: The score based on default timing window periods already in use. The application includes a predefined list of periods per province, and by default, it uses the first entry for the province of the selected waterbody. The user still has the option to define a different (custom) status quo period.\n\n\n\n3.6.4 Important additional calculator features\n\nPeriod of Interest: Users can define a restricted period of the year to limit the search space for optimal timing windows.\nSensitivity to Stressors: By default, all species are considered equally (i.e., sensitivity values are not used). To include species-stressor sensitivity scores from the WUA Selection, check the box labeled “Use sensitivity to stressors.”\nSpecies Weighting: The final section allows users to weight species individually. This is useful to explore the impact of specific species—for example, by setting all weights to 0 except for one, users can isolate its contribution to the overall score.\n\n\n\n\nEntire list of calculator options",
