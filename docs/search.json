    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe Timing Windows Calculator is an interactive Shiny web application designed to support the assessment and refinement of species-specific timing windows for freshwater fish in Canada. Built upon the National Timing Windows Dataset (NTWD), the application provides users with a structured framework to explore fish life stage timing, assess risks associated with works, undertaking and activities (WUA), and generate scientifically informed timing window recommendations.\nThe application serves two primary purposes:\nA key feature of the Timing Windows Calculator is its flexibility—it allows users to:\nBy combining scientific data, user input, and adaptive risk assessment methods, the Timing Windows Calculator provides a robust, decision-support tool for environmental managers, researchers, and policymakers seeking to minimize ecological disruptions while accommodating responsible resource use.",

    "text": "2.1 Objectives and Key Deliverables\nThe project was structured around three core objectives:\n\nDeveloping a National Timing Windows Database (NTWD)\n\nA relational SQLite database was created to integrate comprehensive life history, ecological, and phenological data for freshwater fish across Canada.\n\nIt synthesizes species-specific timing windows for spawning, migration, and early development stages, ensuring that seasonal and ecological constraints of freshwater fish are well-represented.\n\nThe database harmonizes multiple datasets, providing a structured and consistent framework for evaluating species-specific responses to environmental changes.\n\nImplementing a Risk Assessment Framework\n\nThe Timing Windows Calculator guides users through a structured risk assessment framework, ensuring that recommendations are rooted in best available data and scientific methodologies.\n\nThe tool allows users to assess and refine timing windows based on both national datasets and local ecological expertise, ensuring applicability across diverse water bodies.\n\nBuilding an Interactive Shiny Application\n\nA Shiny web application was developed to provide users with an interactive tool for exploring species-specific life stage timing, regional risk assessments, and optimal timing windows.\n\nThe application enables users to modify existing knowledge, incorporate local data, and even conduct risk assessments for waterbodies with no prior knowledge.",
