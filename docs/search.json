Once a type is selected, the map on the right will update accordingly and become interactive.\nMap The map is used to locate a specific lake or river, or to manually place a point that defines the study context. This selection also determines the province, which is used to pre-fill the status quo field in the final section.\nOutput A visual representation of the selected waterbody (or province, in the case of a dropped point) appears on the left, along with several key characteristics (see Figure ‘Examples of Waterbody Selection Types’).\n\n\n\n\nSection ‘Waterbody selection’. 1. Selection; 2. Map; 3. Output.\n\n\nThis first section serves as the entry point to the Timing Windows Calculator. It allows users to select lakes or rivers for which fish species have been recorded; these species will be loaded in the next section.\nNote that the “Selection Options” accordion can be used to limit the number of species pre-filled in the next step. This is especially useful for lakes where a large number of species have been documented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLight gray markers represent waterbodies where fish species have been observed, while dark gray markers indicate waterbodies with no direct species observations. For these, species are inferred based on presence within the surrounding watershed.
