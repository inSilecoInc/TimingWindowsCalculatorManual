## tl;dr: the wizard

If consulting the manual feels cumbersome, you may use the 'Wizard' button to initiate a guided tour of the app. The tour begins with the selection of a lake Nipissing and then leads you through the various sections of the application. Use the `Previous` and `Next` buttons (shown below) to navigate through the tour. To exit the tour at any time, press the `Esc` key.

## Starting with the application

When you start the application, a disclaimer will appear. After reading it, check the "OK" box to proceed to the main page of the app. The interface will look similar to the figure below.

::: {.callout-note}
The application is designed for use on computers with relatively large screens. It has not been optimized for smaller devices or media.

The main page of the application is divided into four interactive sections, each corresponding to a step in the workflow. At startup, only the first section is visible. The remaining three sections will become available after selecting a waterbody.

When the application starts, the page you see includes four key components of the interface.

1. **Navigation Bar**  
   The sticky navigation bar contains three links:  
   - **Home**: Directs to the main page, which includes the core application.  
   - **About**: Provides information about the project.  
   - **Documentation**: Contains both the database documentation and this user manual.

2. **Top-Right Buttons**  
   Located at the top-right of the navigation bar:  
   - Scroll-to-top and scroll-to-bottom buttons for quick navigation.  
   - A button to launch the setup wizard (as described in the previous section).  
   - A Bookmark button (rightmost), which allows users to save the current state of the app. This feature is especially useful for developers when reporting or debugging issues.

3. **Left Panel**  
   Each of the four sections of the application includes a left panel with input options for selection and computation. In the first section, this panel also includes a preview of the selected waterbody's shape.

4. **Right Panel**  
   The right panel displays the main outputs and allows users to refine their selections based on the displayed results.

## Waterbody selection 

The first section allows the user to define the **context** in which the impact of a timing window is being investigated. It includes three main components:

- **Selection**: Users can choose from three selection types â€” **Lakes**, **Rivers**, or **Drop a Pin on the Map**. Once a type is selected, the map on the right will update accordingly and become interactive.

- **Map**: The map is used to locate a specific lake or river, or to manually place a point that defines the study context. This selection also determines the **province**, which is used to pre-fill the status quo field in the final section.

- **Output**: A visual representation of the selected waterbody (or province, in the case of a dropped point) appears on the left, along with several key characteristics (see Figure 'Examples of Waterbody Selection Types').

This first section serves as the entry point to the Timing Windows Calculator. It allows users to select lakes or rivers for which fish species have been recorded; these species will be loaded in the next section.

Note that the "Selection Options" accordion can be used to limit the number of species pre-filled in the next step. This is especially useful for lakes where a large number of species have been documented. 

::: {.callout-note}
Light gray markers represent waterbodies where fish species have been observed, while dark gray markers indicate waterbodies with no direct species observations. For these, species are inferred based on presence within the surrounding watershed. If a point is used, species will be manually added (see next section).

Finally, at the bottom left of the section, there are two buttons:   
* "Clear Selection": Removes the current selection.  
* "Reset View": Resets the map view to display all of Canada.
