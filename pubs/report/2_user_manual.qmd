## tl;dr: the wizard

If consulting the manual feels cumbersome, you may use the 'Wizard' button to initiate a guided tour of the app. The tour begins with the selection of a lake Nipissing and then leads you through the various sections of the application. Use the `Previous` and `Next` buttons (shown below) to navigate through the tour. To exit the tour at any time, press the `Esc` key.
